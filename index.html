    <p class="hev">During the 1900s education was mainly for tyhe Rich or kids in better living standing and the greater amount of 
        the youger generation were all working in worse place then adults and there were likly to be hired in the case that they 
        were smaller and they would be able to get in places it would be harder for adults when fixing the machines but there 
        were also cases in which injury were really common and were a constant.

    <p class="mul2">What was education like in the 1900's?
        Despite the push to improve the nation's educational standards during the early 1900s, 
        very few students advanced beyond grade school. In 1900, only 11 percent of all children between ages 
        fourteen and seventeen were enrolled in high school, and even fewer graduated. Those figures had improved only slightly 
        by 1910. As well as In the early 1900s, children frequently worked in factories. Some children as young as 5 or 6 worked. 
        Many children worked long shifts, sometimes up to 12 hours. They worked under horrible conditions: dangerous fumes, 
        poisonous gases and chemicals, and deadly mechanized equipment.

Education of the
The issue puls a solution in one
The main problem with education in the 1900s was simply the fact that students would receive a short education and it would be kept 
to the bare minimum. This was most common among the poor because public schools were free but fees from home were considered more 
important thus they were dropped early on and those that push for more educated people somehow could not see the vast majority of people 
who could not afford that. But the grass was not greener on the other side of the fence in fact it was far worse as the grass spew fumes 
and took arms and lives of people it was more of a monster no less than a simple blade of grass and that the time that it lived in many 
children of that age signed up for lower paying jobs making them prime targets for the loss of such things.

One of the many things that happened with kids of this time were they received a set amount of education and after they had the least 
to understand people and simple tasks they were taken out of school. Then they would look for jobs in factories and or mine and other 
production based work fields not many of them landed jobs without high risk and low pay because death and injury were common due to the 
fact that the low pay in comparison to adults but pay nonetheless was something that was needed in large families as well as small. 
Because of this loss of limbs and loss of life was was ignored by the factory foreman 
but also it was something you could get compensated for as well as the fact that at there age working in a coal mine with little to no 
protection affected their life span and may have induced lung problems and cave ins in those systems could also endanger there live just
 as much.

A solution to this would be to establish a safe working environment under the same 
industries with higher pay and using the money earned from said industries make a school that teaches 
about that and while squeezing in general studies and other things. With this kind of layout we could eventually 
push out most of the other business leaving the markets untouched so they would either have to migrate business practices 
to another field or be economical crushed because if you get paid more but your kids die or become limb less in these factories 
and you can avoid it and get paid more than. Why would you go to these other companies for work when there is a better place elsewhere 
we could also enforce hygiene in the more unclean working environments with our own resources and improve health as well as providing a 
place they can come back to when they feel they want to keep working with our company until most of the companies with worse conditions 
will fade and die out. 

The conclusion reached was that in  the end if someone were to take control of the 
conditions by making a fairer and better company and environment as well as make a school for it.  
They could not only make money but have both a loyal and almost permanent expansion of your company subordinates and while that is 
happening they could also knock out their competitors and while that's happening make your business the cover of everything safe, 
good pay and better life. Thus making it a required must and when your company reaches financial stability host other things you 
could do like art and government positions but still pushing students to get in the factory jobs because it is your company just 
not forcing them.
